## Thoughts of the day

As I've noticed, vibe coding is still prone to errors. I had to review the code as the spacing in the markdown was not breaking and realized the libraries used by the AI were unpopular or deprecated.

### Opinion

In my opinion it is ok to use AI to boost productivity but definitely not a good idea to leave it all to the AI to do on its own. üòÇ A human intelligence is needed, and someone with expertise in the area.

### Book of the day

I'm currently reading A Hackers Manifest, by McKenzie Wark. it's interesting to see how she described herself being naive when she wrote it back in the 2000s. I also did have this sense of how open source and open knowledge would change the world, but I was naive to neglect how the capital owners took advantage of the good will of the people. And the AI existence itself is a proof of how corporations can take this advantage of open source. I will present my review of the book after I finish it.

### The future

I hope this book helps me figure out a way to take the initiative to make my dreams come true, a dream of collaboration and high and low technology.
peace, out ‚úåüèΩ
